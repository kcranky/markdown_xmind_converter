# Markdown <-> Xmind Converter

## TODOs
- Need to write a markdown to dict parser.
- Add cmdline support for calling on files.
- Add directory-level support.
    - Maybe when creating markdown files from a directory, create a markdown file with links to those files, to act as a "table of contents"?

## Limitations
There are, of course, limitations. Much of both xmind's and markdown's features are not supported, and I don't have plans to support them.
For now, I am just asusming that the only format of data to be parsed by this script consists of structured, nested lists.
